# What is Operating System Security?

The process of ensuring OS availability, confidentiality, integrity is known as operating system security. OS security refers to the processes or measures taken to protect the operating system from dangers, including viruses, worms, malware, and remote hacker intrusions. Operating system security comprises all preventive-control procedures that protect any system assets that could be stolen, modified, or deleted if OS security is breached.

## Operating System Security

Security refers to providing safety for computer system resources like software, CPU, memory, disks, etc. It can protect against all threats, including viruses and unauthorized access. It can be enforced by assuring the operating system's integrity, confidentiality, and availability. If an illegal user runs a computer application, the computer or data stored may be seriously damaged.

System security may be threatened through two violations, and these are as follows:

1. Threat

A program that has the potential to harm the system seriously.

2. Attack

A breach of security that allows unauthorized access to a resource.

There are two types of security breaches that can harm the system: malicious and accidental. Malicious threats are a type of destructive computer code or web script that is designed to cause system vulnerabilities that lead to back doors and security breaches. On the other hand, Accidental Threats are comparatively easier to protect against.

#### Security may be compromised through the breaches. Some of the breaches are as follows:

1. Breach of integrity

This violation has unauthorized data modification.

2. Theft of service

It involves the unauthorized use of resources.

3. Breach of confidentiality

It involves the unauthorized reading of data.

4. Breach of availability

It involves the unauthorized destruction of data.

5. Denial of service

It includes preventing legitimate use of the system. Some attacks may be accidental.

### The goal of Security System

There are several goals of system security. Some of them are as follows:

1. Integrity

Unauthorized users must not be allowed to access the system's objects, and users with insufficient rights should not modify the system's critical files and resources.

2. Secrecy

The system's objects must only be available to a small number of authorized users. The system files should not be accessible to everyone.

3. Availability

All system resources must be accessible to all authorized users, i.e., no single user/process should be able to consume all system resources. If such a situation arises, service denial may occur. In this case, malware may restrict system resources and preventing legitimate processes from accessing them.
