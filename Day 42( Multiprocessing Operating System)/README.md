# Multiprocessing Operating system
In operating systems, to improve the performance of more than one CPU can be used within one computer system called Multiprocessor operating system.

Multiple CPUs are interconnected so that a job can be divided among them for faster execution. When a job finishes, results from all CPUs are collected and compiled to give the final output. Jobs needed to share main memory and they may also share other system resources among themselves. Multiple CPUs can also be used to run multiple jobs simultaneously.

For Example: UNIX Operating system is one of the most widely used multiprocessing systems.

##### To employ a multiprocessing operating system effectively, the computer system must have the following things:


A motherboard is capable of handling multiple processors in a multiprocessing operating system.

Processors are also capable of being used in a multiprocessing system.

### Advantages of multiprocessing operating system are:

Increased reliability: Due to the multiprocessing system, processing tasks can be distributed among several processors. This increases reliability as if one processor fails; the task can be given to another processor for completion.

Increased throughout: As several processors increase, more work can be done in less

The economy of Scale: As multiprocessors systems share peripherals, secondary storage devices, and power supplies, they are relatively cheaper than single-processor systems.

### Disadvantages of Multiprocessing operating System

Operating system of multiprocessing is more complex and sophisticated as it takes care of multiple CPUs at the same time.
