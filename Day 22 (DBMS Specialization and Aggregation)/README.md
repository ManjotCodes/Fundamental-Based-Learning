# Specialization

Specialization is a top-down approach, and it is opposite to Generalization. In specialization, one higher level entity can be broken down into two lower level entities.
Specialization is used to identify the subset of an entity set that shares some distinguishing characteristics.
Normally, the superclass is defined first, the subclass and its related attributes are defined next, and relationship set are then added.

For example: In an Employee management system, EMPLOYEE entity can be specialized as TESTER or DEVELOPER based on what role they play in the company.

# Aggregation

In aggregation, the relation between two entities is treated as a single entity. In aggregation, relationship with its corresponding entities is aggregated into a higher level entity.


For example: Center entity offers the Course entity act as a single entity in the relationship which is in a relationship with another entity visitor. In the real world, if a visitor visits a coaching center then he will never enquiry about the Course only or just about the Center instead he will ask the enquiry about both.
