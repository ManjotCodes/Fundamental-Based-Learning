# SQL SELECT Statement

In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to query or retrieve data from a table in the database. The returns data is stored in a table, and the result table is known as result-set.

## Syntax

SELECT column1, column2, ...  
FROM table_name;  

Here, the expression is the field name of the table that you want to select data from.


Use the following syntax to select all the fields available in the table:

SELECT  *  FROM table_name;
