# RAID

RAID refers to redundancy array of the independent disk. It is a technology which is used to connect multiple secondary storage devices for increased performance, data redundancy or both. It gives you the ability to survive one or more drive failure depending upon the RAID level used.

It consists of an array of disks in which multiple disks are connected to achieve different goals.

## RAID technology

There are 7 levels of RAID schemes. These schemas are as RAID 0, RAID 1, ...., RAID 6.

These levels contain the following characteristics:


It contains a set of physical disk drives.

In this technology, the operating system views these separate disks as a single logical disk.

In this technology, data is distributed across the physical drives of the array.

Redundancy disk capacity is used to store parity information.

In case of disk failure, the parity information can be helped to recover the data.
