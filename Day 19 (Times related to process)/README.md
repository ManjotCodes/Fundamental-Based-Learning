# Various Times related to the Process


1. Arrival Time
The time at which the process enters into the ready queue is called the arrival time.

2. Burst Time
The total amount of time required by the CPU to execute the whole process is called the Burst Time. This does not include the waiting time. It is confusing to calculate the execution time for a process even before executing it hence the scheduling problems based on the burst time cannot be implemented in reality.

3. Completion Time
The Time at which the process enters into the completion state or the time at which the process completes its execution, is called completion time.

4. Turnaround time
The total amount of time spent by the process from its arrival to its completion, is called Turnaround time.

5. Waiting Time
The Total amount of time for which the process waits for the CPU to be assigned is called waiting time.

6. Response Time
The difference between the arrival time and the time at which the process first gets the CPU is called Response Time.
