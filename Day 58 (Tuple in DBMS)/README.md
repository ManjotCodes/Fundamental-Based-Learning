# Tuple in DBMS

A tuple is an essential component in the relational database management system. Relational database management stores data in tables.

A tuple contains all the information of a particular entity. The table is composed of fields and a tuple. A tuple represents a row in the table and the data associated with the entity. The data in RDBMS is arranged across several columns and rows. The column represents the attribute of an entity, such as age, gender, marks, etc.

In the DBMS relational model, the database is represented as a collection of relations between entities and their attributes.

A relation represents a table that contains certain values in the form of rows and columns, where a row or tuple is a collection of related data values. Each value stored inside each row, column, and the table is important for determining the table's name. Though the data is arranged in tables in RDBMS, the data storage does not depend on the logical structure of the data.

A tuple in the DBMS refers to a single record in the relational db. It represents the entire data in a single row of the relational table. The data is stored in the table format by attribute and tuples in DBMS.

The data may be available in an entire spreadsheet in the database consisting of numerous rows known as a tuple with a value corresponding to each field present in the tuple.

The user can perform several operations on the data stored in the field or tuple of the tables. These operations include inserting, removing, modifying, or update on the data values stored in the table. The user can also perform a join operation on the tuples in two different relations. Join operations are used to combine the data values in two tables.

## Tuple

Edward Frank Codd invented the relational database management system while working for IBM. He defined the relationship as a collection of unique tuples. It can be represented as a set of tuples (d1, d2, â€¦.dn) where each element di of the relation is a member of a particular domain Di.

There is no fixed arrangement of the components or elements of the tuple of a relation. The tuple in DBMS differs from the tuple that was defined in mathematics. Every component in the database is referred to as a value for the attribute. It can be a name, a number, or a date. The attribute can have only one datatype assigned to it.

A tuple in a database management system is a combination of field values. A field value is related to a common field name and a component associated with the field domain. In a tuple, having two unique values with the same values is impossible.
