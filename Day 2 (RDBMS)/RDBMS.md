# What is RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

All modern database management systems like SQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, ORACLE, My-SQL, and Microsoft Access are based on RDBMS.

It is called Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) because it is based on the relational model introduced by E.F. Codd.

## How it works
Data is represented in terms of tuples (rows) in RDBMS.

A relational database is the most commonly used database. It contains several tables, and each table has its primary key.

Due to a collection of an organized set of tables, data can be accessed easily in RDBMS.

## Brief History of RDBMS
From 1970 to 1972, E.F. Codd published a paper to propose using a relational database model.

RDBMS is originally based on E.F. Codd's relational model invention.

Following are the various terminologies of RDBMS:

What is RDBMS

## What is table/Relation?
Everything in a relational database is stored in the form of relations. The RDBMS database uses tables to store data. A table is a collection of related data entries and contains rows and columns to store data. Each table represents some real-world objects such as person, place, or event about which information is collected. The organized collection of data into a relational table is known as the logical view of the database.

## Properties of a Relation:

Each relation has a unique name by which it is identified in the database.
Relation does not contain duplicate tuples.
The tuples of a relation have no specific order.
All attributes in a relation are atomic, i.e., each cell of a relation contains exactly one value.
A table is the simplest example of data stored in RDBMS.


## What is a row or record?
A row of a table is also called a record or tuple. It contains the specific information of each entry in the table. It is a horizontal entity in the table. For example, The above table contains 5 records.

### Properties of a row:

No two tuples are identical to each other in all their entries.

All tuples of the relation have the same format and the same number of entries.

The order of the tuple is irrelevant. 

They are identified by their content, not by their position.
