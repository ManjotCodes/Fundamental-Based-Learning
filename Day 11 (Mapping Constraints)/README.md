# Mapping Constraints

A mapping constraint is a data constraint that expresses the number of entities to which another entity can be related via a relationship set.

It is most useful in describing the relationship sets that involve more than two entity sets.

For binary relationship set R on an entity set A and B, there are four possible mapping cardinalities. These are as follows:

1.) One to one (1:1)

2.) One to many (1:M)

3.) Many to one (M:1)

4.) Many to many (M:M)

## One-to-One
In one-to-one mapping, an entity in E1 is associated with at most one entity in E2, and an entity in E2 is associated with at most one entity in E1.

## One-to-Many

In one-to-many mapping, an entity in E1 is associated with any number of entities in E2, and an entity in E2 is associated with at most one entity in E1.

## Many-to-One
In one-to-many mapping, an entity in E1 is associated with at most one entity in E2, and an entity in E2 is associated with any number of entities in E1.

## Many-to-Many

In many-to-many mapping, an entity in E1 is associated with any number of entities in E2, and an entity in E2 is associated with any number of entities in E1.
